    <p>Hey there! My name is Kaleb Emery, and I am a prospective software developer enrolled in Eleven Fifty Academy.
        Before this journey, I completed my Bachelor of Science at Ball State University. My passion for marketing has only grown after my studies came to an end in 2018b but wanted a change. 
        I believe software development is my perfect crossroad between creative and analytical thinking. I am eagerly looking forward to the obstacles I will face in my career as a developer, and expect it to be just as rewarding as it is challenging.
        In my freetime I love to bike, and I am always on the lookout for new live music venues and festivals.

    <p class="lead">My background and career have been in Information Technology.  I began my career as an COBOL programmer and quickly moved to RPG development.  My last position was as a Software Engineer Manager.  I enjoy the problem solving aspects that are part of software development.  Now after attending Eleven Fifty Academy's Software Development Bootcamp, I am beginning a new chapter and pursuing work as a C# .Net developer. </p>
