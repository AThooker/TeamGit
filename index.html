    <p>I was born and raised in Tipton, IN. I attended college at IU bloomington and graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice. 
    After deciding that path was not for me, I purused several different jobs in various fields. 
    These decisions led me to the tech industry. Outside of my career interests, I am a travel junkie and a huge family man.</p>

    <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-size: large;"> After a decade of working for the same company, in the warehouse industry, at levels varying from entry level to middle management I decided it was time for a change.  I left what I knew and embarked on a new journey in the world of computers. I am a recent graduate of the Web Development Bootcamp at Eleven Fifty Academy. After such a great experience and the feeling of accomplishment from all that I learned I decided to start the Software Development program. Outside of coding I am an avid football and race fan, and enjoy traveling with my family.</p>
