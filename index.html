    <p>I was born and raised in Tipton, IN. I attended college at IU bloomington and graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice. 
    After deciding that path was not for me, I purused several different jobs in various fields. 
    These decisions led me to the tech industry. Outside of my career interests, I am a travel junkie and a huge family man.</p>
