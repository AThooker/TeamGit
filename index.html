    <p class="lead">My background and career have been in Information Technology.  I began my career as an COBOL programmer and quickly moved to RPG development.  My last position was as a Software Engineer Manager.  I enjoy the problem solving aspects that are part of software development.  Now after attending Eleven Fifty Academy's Software Development Bootcamp, I am beginning a new chapter and pursuing work as a C# .Net developer. </p>
